There once was a succotash, quite cuddly, might I add. His name was Jeremy.
Jeremy lived in a distant land called Refrigeratoria. Refrigeratoria was a cold land, between 35 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit. The land housed many organisms: apples, cheeses, juice, and Thanksgiving leftovers.
Jeremy lived amongst the Thanksgiving leftovers, but one day he decided to
visit the apple people... 

 Jeremy missed his mom in Italy so much so he decided to buy a $40 plane ticket to go visit her.
After a long flight, Jeremy met and hugged mom tightly.
However, Jeremy could not go back to Refrigeratoria due to the CoCoRoRo monster.

Jeremy, however, was determined to get back to Refrigeratoria. He decided to defeat the CoCoRoRo monster himself to bring peace to Refrigeratoria. He bought another plane ticket and went to his country. As soon as he landed he saw CoCoRoRo infront of him.
